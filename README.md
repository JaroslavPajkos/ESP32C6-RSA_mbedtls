# RSA Digital Signature Time Comparison

This project implements an RSA digital signature application using the **mbedtls** library on an ESP32-C6 microcontroller, which features a RISC-V processor with hardware acceleration for RSA up to 3072 bits. It compares the performance (in CPU cycles) of RSA signature generation and verification for different key sizes (2048, 3072, and 4096 bits) using PKCS#1 v1.5 and PSS padding schemes. For 4096-bit signatures, the watchdog timer must be disabled due to the longer execution time. The project includes test certificates and keys for cryptographic operations.

## Project Overview

- **Author**: Jaroslav Pajkos
- **Year**: 2025
- **Purpose**: Measure and compare the execution time of RSA digital signature operations (signing and verification) for different key sizes and padding schemes on the ESP32-C6.
- **Platform**: ESP32-C6 with ESP-IDF framework
- **Library**: mbedtls for cryptographic operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Generates RSA keys for 2048, 3072, and 4096 bits.
  - Computes SHA-256 hash of a test message.
  - Signs the message using PKCS#1 v1.5 and PSS padding.
  - Verifies signatures and measures execution time in CPU cycles.
  - Includes test certificates and keys (RSA 1024-bit, ED25519, etc.) for cryptographic testing.
  - Leverages RISC-V hardware acceleration for RSA up to 3072 bits.

## Repository Structure

- `CMakeLists.txt`: Build configuration for the ESP-IDF project.
- `mbedtls_rsa.c`: Main source file implementing RSA signature operations and timing measurements.
- `certs_test.h`: Header file containing test certificates and keys (RSA, DH, DSA, ED25519).
- `README.md`: This file.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: ESP32-C6 development board
- **Software**:
  - [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/) (Espressif IoT Development Framework)
  - [mbedtls](https://tls.mbed.org/) library (included as a dependency in ESP-IDF)
  - CMake and a compatible build tool
- **Tools**: Serial monitor (e.g., minicom or PuTTY) to view console output

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JaroslavPajkos/ESP32C6-RSA_mbedtls
   cd ESP32C6-RSA_mbedtls\mbedtls_rsa
   ```

2. **Set Up ESP-IDF**:
   Follow the [ESP-IDF Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) to install and configure ESP-IDF.

3. **Configure the Project**:
   Run the following command to configure the project:
   ```bash
   idf.py set-target esp32c6
   idf.py menuconfig
   ```
   Ensure the mbedtls component is enabled (included by default in ESP-IDF) and disable the watchdog timer if testing 4096-bit keys.

4. **Build the Project**:
   Compile the project using:
   ```bash
   idf.py build
   ```

5. **Flash to ESP32-C6**:
   Connect your ESP32-C6 board and flash the firmware:
   ```bash
   idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash
   ```
   Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the appropriate serial port for your system.

6. **Monitor Output**:
   View the console output using:
   ```bash
   idf.py monitor
   ```

## Usage

- The program runs automatically upon flashing to the ESP32-C6.
- It performs the following steps:
  1. Initializes mbedtls contexts and seeds the random number generator.
  2. Computes the SHA-256 hash of the test message: `"OPEN MESSAGE FOR ENCRYPTION"`.
  3. For each key size (2048, 3072, 4096 bits):
     - Generates an RSA key pair.
     - Signs the message hash using PKCS#1 v1.5 and PSS padding.
     - Verifies the signatures and measures the CPU cycles for verification.
  4. Prints the results to the console, including:
     - Message hash
     - Signatures (PKCS#1 v1.5 and PSS)
     - Verification times in CPU cycles
- The test certificates in `certs_test.h` are not used in the main program but are included for potential cryptographic testing.
- **Note**: For 4096-bit operations, the watchdog timer is disabled to accommodate the extended execution time.

## Performance Measurements

The following table presents measured execution times (in milliseconds) for RSA signature verification using mbedtls, conducted on the ESP32-C6 with a processor frequency of 160 MHz. The table compares results for key sizes 2048 and 4096 bits, with optimization levels -O2 and -Os, across PKCS#1 v1.5, PSS, and no padding schemes.

| RSA  | Optimization | mbedtls (ms) |
|------|--------------|--------------|
|      |              | PKCS v1.5    |
| 2048 | -O2          | 54.18        |
| 2048 | -Os          | 83.49        |
| 4096 | -O2          | 207.08       |
| 4096 | -Os          | 319.85       |
|      |              | PSS          |
| 2048 | -O2          | 54.57        |
| 2048 | -Os          | 83.88        |
| 4096 | -O2          | 207.78       |
| 4096 | -Os          | 320.58       |
|      |              | No Padding   |
| 2048 | -O2          | 53.97        |
| 2048 | -Os          | 83.25        |
| 4096 | -O2          | 206.71       |
| 4096 | -Os          | 319.43       |

- **Description**: The table shows the time taken to verify RSA signatures for different key sizes and optimization levels using mbedtls. Times are measured in milliseconds at a constant processor frequency of 160 MHz. Lower values indicate better performance, with -O2 generally outperforming -Os due to optimization differences.

## Notes

- **Performance Measurement**: The `start()` and `end()` functions use RISC-V cycle counters to measure execution time. The reported cycles are divided by 160 for normalization (specific to the ESP32-C6's clock configuration).
- **Hardware Acceleration**: The ESP32-C6's RISC-V processor provides hardware acceleration for RSA operations up to 3072 bits. For 4096-bit keys, acceleration is not fully utilized, requiring longer execution times and watchdog timer disablement.
- **Certificates**: The `certs_test.h` file includes test certificates and keys from wolfSSL, which can be used for additional cryptographic experiments.
- **Error Handling**: The program includes robust error handling for mbedtls operations, with detailed error messages printed to the console.
- **Limitations**: The project is optimized for ESP32-C6 and may require modifications for other platforms.
